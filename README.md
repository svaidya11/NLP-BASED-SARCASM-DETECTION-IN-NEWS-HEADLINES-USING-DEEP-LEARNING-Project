# NLP-BASED-SARCASM-DETECTION-IN-NEWS-HEADLINES-USING-DEEP-LEARNING-Project

Abstract:

Sarcasm is commonly used in news and detecting sarcasm in headline news is challenging for humans and thus for computers. 
The media regularly seem to engage sarcasm in their news headline to get the attention of people. However, people
find it tough to detect the sarcasm in the headline news, hence receiving a mistaken idea about that specific news and additionally
spreading it to their friends, colleagues, etc. Consequently, an intelligentsystem that is able to distinguish between can sarcasm none
sarcasm automatically is very important.

The aim of the study :

is to build a sarcasm model that detect headline news using machine Learning
and deep learning and attempt to understand how a computer learns the patterns of sarcasm.
When it comes to opinion and emotions of the people towards any topic or service, evaluation of the 
accurate sentiment is of the spirit because unfair or incorrectly recognized comment may lead to vagueness
for users plus for the system itself.
